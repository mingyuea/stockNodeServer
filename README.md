This is the server-side to my fake stock trading application, written in Node/Express.

This is purely a personal project, no real money/stocks will be traded. DO NOT RELY ON THE INFORMATION FROM THIS APPLICATION FOR ACTUAL TRADING PURPOSES.

Here, password hashing for login/signup is performed. This application also performs the fetching of data to the third-party IEX API. IEX provides the stock data used for my application.
